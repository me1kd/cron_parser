Note
====

1. It is also recommended to run the commands in a clean virtual environment for python.
2. If there is any unexpected issue that the program cannot be installed by setuptools, the parser.py is in <root>/src/cron_parser and can be executed in <root>/src/ by **python3 -m cron_parser.parser**, which has the same usage as gcclac. This also depends requirements.txt. Command is **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**
